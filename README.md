# few-shot-bioassays
This repository contains a model for few-shot learning based on ChEMBL data

# Data

`bioassay_table`: First attempt at loading CHEMBL data
`bioassay_table_filtered`: Loading organism CHEMBL data filtered based on criteria specified in `extract_table`
`bioassay_table_filtered_active`: Temporary data, saved after `filter_assay` python file in `filter_table.py`
`bopassay_table_standard`: Dataframe above modified such that the SMILES strings are correctly loaded.
